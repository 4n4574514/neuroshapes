Reconstruction of a neuron morphology from slice typically follows the injection of a dye during a whole cell patch clamp recording. Some of the activities and entities shown here are hence shared with the in vitro whole cell patch clamp recording. Metadata is collected on the subject used in the experiment, the slice containing the cell, the labeled cell and the reconstructed neuron morphology. The dye-filled neuron is most commonly visualized using a histological technique following the fixation of the brain tissue. The stained cells are annotated and then reconstructed. Metadata from all these procedures is captured as well as the protocols used and the persons, software and organizations involved in each of the steps.","title":"Description"},{"location":"/docs/data-models/morphology/morphology-reconstruction.html#supported-data-queries","text":"The following points describe an example subset of questions supported by the data provenance pattern:\nRetrieve morphology reconstructions from a given brain region.
